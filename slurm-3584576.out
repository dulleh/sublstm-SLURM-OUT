`bottleneck` is a tool that can be used as an initial step for debugging
bottlenecks in your program.

It summarizes runs of your script with the Python profiler and PyTorch's
autograd profiler. Because your script will be profiled, please ensure that it
exits in a finite amount of time.

For more complicated uses of the profilers, please see
https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html and
https://pytorch.org/docs/master/autograd.html#profiler for more information.
